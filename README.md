# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This is a weather dashboard designed to give a forecast based on openweather's API. I wanted to create a dashboard that was enjoyable to use and displayed the needed information in a nice looking package. It will help with quick weather searches that have become a daily habit in today's world. I learned plenty of Javascript and API fetch request interactions with this project. I also gained a lot of experience in dynamically creating and styling HTML elements through Javascript. 

All in all, I am proud with how this project evolved. I am looking forward to adding additional quirks to it at a later date. Using Bootstrap and UIkit as shortcuts to styling was immensely helpful. Enjoy searching weather for cities with Sunny (that's the large sun above.)

## Installation

This dashboard is meant to be accessed in the browser here: https://chrisvulpine.github.io/weather-dashboard/

## Usage
On page load, the user is greeted by Sunny sliding in and presented with a search bar and labeled buttons. After typing in a city name into the search bar and clicking the Search button the current day's weather (date, icon, temp, wind speed, humidity) will be displayed, and a 5 day forecast will be generated below that with the same information for the corresponding days. 

Each searched city will be logged into local storage and the History dropdown can be used to search that city again. If the user wants to clear this history, the Clear History button can be used to do so.
